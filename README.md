# TensorFlow-CNN-Classifier
This project demonstrates the implementation of a convolutional neural network for image classification using TensorFlow. By adjusting the hyperparameters and architecture, the model's performance can be optimized for various image classification tasks. The model can be extended further by adding more layers or experimenting with different activation functions and optimizers.
